Changes I've implemented:

1#
Completed the missing parts and centered them to make it look good.

2#
Added an eater below the Glider gun as a fix of self destruction (it's an 'it' idk if i can refer to it using 'self' but you get it, we can say 'itself' so it's true? prob).

3#
Replaced drawGosperGliderGun with drawPentaDecathlon :).

4#
Replaced renderer and draw with Drawgrid, so i can add some changes like grid lines and styles easily.

5#
Added buttons to adjust the game speed.

6#
Made some styling, ofc i had some help cuz i'm not that creative :/.
